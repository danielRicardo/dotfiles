# My Dotfiles
Nothing fancy here, these are just my dotfiles.
They are still a work in progress, so I wouldn't recommend copying them just yet.

## My toolset
  * Keyboard: [Redox](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard)
  * Package manager (macOS): [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  * Shell: [zsh](https://zsh.org) + [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
  * Vim 
  * Tmux

## Usage
  * To install everything from scratch, run the `init.sh` script
  * The `bin` folder contains other scripts for more dedicated tasks
    * `brew.sh` will install homebrew and my list of formulae
    * `link.sh` will create symlinks from all the config files to their proper location in the home folder
